**The next 18 - 36 Months**
-----------------------------

Congratulations if you have survived the first 18 months. Most likely
you have a product or a service that customers are willing to pay now.
So you are either looking at rapidly scaling your org now or you are
considering your exit plan(sell your startup).

Assuming you are looking at scaling, you will be spending a lot of time
on building, managing and troubleshooting teams during this time. Your
management principles will be your guiding force during this time

**Management Philosophy**
--------------------------

Everyone has their own set of management philosophies. Here are some of
the management philosophies that I practice

**Golden Rule** - **Treat the people the same way you want them to treat
you**

-   This is a people intensive industry. Leaders who are not ethical
    will be found out quickly

**Communication - As though you are on a live TV with your CEO**

-   Try not to be impulsive. Think from your company interests, followed
    by your BU/Group/Team and the last would be yours

**Build upon people strengths - And not weaknesses**

-   Match up people aspirations, strengths to opportunities so that they
    can grow

**Prioritize the hard problems - **

-   I learnt it the hard way. Need to take the problem head-on. Avoiding
    isn't going to solve the issue and it is going to snowball into much
    larger issue

**Relationships - Battle and War Analogy**

-   Value long term relationships compared to short term transactional
    relations. You can look at workplace relationships into 3. i.e.
    **Managing your team, Managing your Peers and Managing Up**. During
    my early years in mgmt, I spent too much time managing down vs
    managing up or managing sideways. However all of them are important

**Characteristics of High-Performance Teams**
-----------------------------------------------

No two teams are identical and it is hard to figure out what
distinguishes a high performance team. Here are some of my observations.

***Chasing the North Star***

The teams perform well when they are clear on the vision and mission
statement. At the individual team member level, clear roles and how it
maps to the overall success of the product is critical. Performance is
best measured with numbers. **OKR** is a great framework that helps team
members judge their scores and align accordingly. Absence of these key
ingredients can result in lower performance.

***Being Inclusive***

While it is natural for each team member to possess different strengths,
it is important to hear diverse opinions and share mutual respect.
Leaders can enforce this with their action and this soon trickles down
to each individual member. **Anonymous** **Surveys** are great ways to
capture the sentiments around inclusive culture

***Motivation***

This is probably best captured by **Maslow\'s** hierarchy of needs. 
This comprises a five-tier model of human needs, often depicted as
hierarchical levels within a pyramid.

Most newcomers in India typically start at the lower levels of the
Pyramid and as they gain experience their motivation factors go higher
up in the pyramid. While this is mostly true in my experience, I have
been seeing a change in the last couple of hires of New College Grads.
It is probably heralding India Coming of age (For the good)

***Disagree and Commit***

High performance teams typically debate but do agree to commit to a
plan. **Communication** is critical to resolve conflicts in a timely
fashion. 

**Troubleshooting Teams**
--------------------------

Leaders are typically second or third level managers. It is tricky to
figure out when to intervene and not step on your manager's toes. One
good way to figure out the timing is based on **signals** coming from
the team. 

If the team is **working hard but isn't able to deliver,** have quality
issues or have morale problems, it is time for you to take immediate
action. You may either want to add some help (read bring in people with
the right skill sets or temp help, review the workload, share the pain
with the grunt work with other teams are some of the techniques you can
use)

If the team is performing extremely well but are doing the same thing
for a long time, it is also time for you to intervene. This can result
in people building empires and creating **artificial obstacles** to
other teams. A good way to solve this problem is by **allocating new
work or rotating work**. This helps the team learn continuously but will
definitely bring down your popularity. 

**Where Is the Monkey?**
-------------------------

During the first 18 months, the team is small and it is easy to
brainstorm ideas. However as the org becomes big, your urge to jump in
and help with a solution can have a negative impact. Not only will it
impact your ability to spend time on the other critical areas of work,
it will also encourage people to use your name for making the decisions.
Instead, you should push for accountability for the team and not pile up
work on yourself. I highly recommend you read this [[hbr
