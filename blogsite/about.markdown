Hi Folks,

Welcome to my virtual home

I have lived in India and US for most part of my adult life. I call Bangalore, Sunnyvale and Kumta as home.

Professionally, I have spent most of my time in Systems Software. I have covered Networking, Storage, Virtualization, Security, Cloud and AI/ML during the span of years. I have 25 Approved and Pending Patents in this domain

About 5 years back, I decided to move back to India. I do get a lot of questions about the move, life in Bangalore as compared to the US, building teams in India and things to watch out for. I hope to cover them in the next set of blogs

Always excited to hear from folks, please do drop a note

Sam
